Pacman Polynomial Feature Construction
Date: 11/29/18

Description: 
	In the provided eclipse project is a short experiment showcasing the 
	potential performance differeces polynomial featuere construction can
	have on a Sarsa and a Q-learning agent learning to play Pacman. Details 
	of the problem and the experiment are aviable in the provided paper. 

Usage:
   	In order to run my two experiments described in my paper simply open
	the eclipse project and then open the RunTest class in the pp/src folder
	and you'll find an Experiment1() and Experiment2() method invoked in 
	main. Uncomment the experiment you would like to run and then run 
	RunTest.java in eclipse.
