Description: 
    In the provided python file is a short experiment showcasing how value iteration can be used
    to solve the classic RL problem known as the "Gambler's Problem." Details of the problem and 
    the experiment are aviable in the provided paper. 

Usage:
    If you would like to run your own experiment, add an intance of the GamblerExp class to main() 
    and then run it's experiment() method. Examples are provided in main. The meaning of the 
    GamblerExp's constructor's arguments are also detailed in the comments in the code. I hope the 
    meaning of each line will be clear enough in conjunction with the provided paper. This was not
    designed to be user-friendly, only to produce the graphs which feature in the corresponding     	paper.
